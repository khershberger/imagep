Add a QListWidget as a dockable sidebar.  
There shoould be a item in the list for each layer that is added to the LayeredViewer.  LayeredViewer should only paint the layer that is currently selected the list.

Please implement the following functionality when the dot action icon is clicked:
1. Provide a visual indication that the icon has been clicked
2. Create a new AnnotationPoint for the currently selected layer
3. Have the AnnotationPoint follow the mouse cursor until the left button is clicked.
4. Once clicked accept text input from the keyboard to define the AnnotationPoint label value
5. After the user presses enter return the dot action to it's default visual appearance.


Refactor the code such that all of the layer objects are stored within layer_list_widget.  Use the UserRole property of each QListWidgetItem to store the layer objects.  When a new config is loaded, create a new QListWidgetItem for that configruation and then create a child QListWidgetItem for each layer.  Provide LayeredViewer a reference to the QListWidgetItem associated with the new configuration file.  LayeredViewer should pull all layer infomration from the provided QListWidgetItem.
